# Functions-Tools-Agents-Langchain Course Notebooks

## Introduction

This repository contains modified Jupyter notebooks originally from the "Functions, Tools, Agents, and Langchain" course provided by DeepLearning.AI. The modifications address issues with legacy functions from Langchain and OpenAI, ensuring the notebooks are up-to-date and functional.

## Motivation

The original course material utilizes certain functions from Langchain and OpenAI that have since been deprecated or altered. In order to keep the educational content accessible and usable, I have updated the notebooks to align with the current versions of these tools. These amendments are intended to help other learners engage with the course content without technical interruptions.
